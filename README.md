# DSnAlgoCodes
Codes written while learning 
1. Algorithms part 1 ( Robert Sedgewick Course on Coursera )
2. Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures ( by UCSD on Coursera )

inside src folders, package name is the topic I was going through, in the courses.

Packages starting with 
a) algorithms1 => Sedgewick course
b) ucsdCourse => UCSD course

If package name is algorithms1.unionFind, all the .java files inside are my implementations of various union-Find algos
e.g.
=> QuickFind.java  (Code for quick find)
=> QuickUnion.java (code for quick union)
